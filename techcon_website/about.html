<h3>History:</h3>
<p>
  TechCon was born from a simple yet powerful idea: that the future of technology should be built by everyone, for everyone. In the early 2020s, a group of passionate technologists, educators, and ethicists observed a growing need for a space where the rapid advancements in fields like AI and immersive gaming could be explored not just for their technical prowess, but for their potential human impact. They envisioned a gathering that transcended traditional conferences, one that would actively foster creation, champion ethical dialogue, and break down silos between disciplines and demographics.
